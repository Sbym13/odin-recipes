Day 1:
This project consists in developing a HTML5 based website, using the knowledge adquired through the odin project.
This readme document will serve as a registration of my progress (besides commits) and as a self reflection tool.
Could conclude the home page + 1 recipe today, besides paving the road for the next 2 recipes.
Day 2:
Could complete the rest of the exercise easily, the other 2 recipes were really not a struggle at all.
